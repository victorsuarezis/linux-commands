```

Flags may be combined in intuitive ways. Example: to search sheets on the
"personal" cheatpath that are tagged with "networking" and match a regex:

```sh
cheat -p personal -t networking --regex -s '(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'
```

## Format

Cheatsheets are plain-text files that begin with an optional "front matter"
header in YAML format. The header may be used to assign "tags" to a sheet, and
to specify the sheet's syntax (`bash`, `python`, `go`, etc).

When possible, cheatsheets should conform to this format:

```sh
---
syntax: bash
tags: [ vcs, development ]
---
# To stage all changes in the current directory:
git add --all

# To commit staged changes:
git commit -m <message>
```

As a guideline, it is preferred to use [docopt][] syntax when specifying
parameter placeholders. In edge-cases where that syntax may cause confusion, it
is permissible to use placeholder values (`foo.txt`, `example.com`, etc.) as
necessary.
